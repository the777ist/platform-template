# Open items, review notes & fill-in markers — consolidated index

> **Auto-generated** from `PLAN.md` + `docs/phase-*.md` (regenerate after editing the
> guides). A navigational index into the guides — each entry is a `file:line` you can jump
> to, not a second source of truth. Three categories:
>
> 1. **⚠️ REVIEW / TO CONFIRM** — verify-at-the-keyboard items. `/implement` must resolve
>    each when it reaches it (run the install, check the tool/output) or STOP and ask.
>    Enumerated in full below.
> 2. **TODO-\* / PLACEHOLDER-\* tokens** — intentional fill-in slots in skeletons
>    (`TODO-EAS-PROJECT-ID`, `example` org, `PLACEHOLDER-pin-exact`, …). NOT open questions;
>    they're swap-points, and Phase 7 & 8 ship a `git grep` gate asserting exactly these
>    survive stamping. Counted, not enumerated.
> 3. **Deferred (by design)** — cross-phase handoffs owned by a later phase; they live in
>    each guide's `## Open questions / deferred` section and are picked up by the dependent
>    phase's `## Prerequisites`. Not gaps.

## 1. ⚠️ REVIEW / TO CONFIRM items (verify-or-ask)

### `docs/phase-1-root-tooling.md` (16)

- L23: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM: PLAN.md does not pin an exact patch for `mise` itself, nor the host OS. Steps below assume a POSIX shell (the env reports Linux). Adjust shell quoting on Windows.
- L166: ⚠️ REVIEW: PLAN "Workflows" notes EAS relied on a committed `.npmrc` for workspace detection. Verify EAS (Phase 8) still keys off `.npmrc` presence vs. needing the linker setting itself — under pnpm 11 the linker is in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so if EAS expected `node-linker` *inside* `.npmrc` that workaround may need revisiting.
- L218: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM: Exact dep versions. PLAN.md pins Turborepo 2.9 (so `turbo` is set to `2.9.0` — confirm the exact 2.9.x patch at install time; the 2.9.x line is live as of June 2026). Prettier/lefthook/typescript patch versions are not pinned in PLAN; the `^` ranges above are reasonable defaults — replace with whatever the lockfile resolves and pin if stricter reproducibility is wanted. `"name": "platform-template"` stays `platform-template` (matches the repo template), but note PLAN's naming convention warns the monorepo name never drives app/infra ids (those come from product names) — so this name is cosmetic only.
- L277: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM: PLAN lists task names `openapi`, `build`, `export:web`, `dev`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`. It does not give a literal root `turbo.json`; the `outputs` for `build` (`dist`, generated `*.gen.ts`, `renderer`) are inferred from the graph description and may be refined per-package later. Confirm exact `turbo` 2.9.x schema URL/fields against the installed version.
- L319: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM: PLAN names exactly three knobs (strict / moduleResolution bundler / noEmit). The additional flags above are conventional hardening, not PLAN-mandated — trim if a downstream tool (e.g. babel-preset-expo) conflicts.
- L433: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM: Specific style knobs (printWidth 100, double quotes, etc.) aren't dictated by PLAN — these are conventional defaults. Adjust to team taste; they only need to be consistent repo-wide.
- L501: Module format note: PLAN's `tailwind.config.js` consumes this via `presets: ["@platform/config/tailwind-preset"]` and Tailwind configs are loaded by the Tailwind/NativeWind toolchain in CommonJS context. This file is authored as CommonJS (`module.exports`) even though the package is `"type": "module"`, hence the `.js` export maps to a CJS-shaped file. If Tailwind's loader rejects it under an ESM package, rename to `tailwind-preset.cjs` and update the `exports` subpath. ⚠️ TO CONFIRM against the NativeWind v4 + Tailwind toolchain in Phase 2.
- L557: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM: The exact `types`/`lib` arrays per preset depend on packages introduced in Phase 2+ (`expo`, `react-native` type packages). Treat these as starting points; reconcile when the first app workspace is added.
- L685: # separate lefthook command needed. (See ⚠️ note below.)
- L702: ⚠️ OPEN / TO CONFIRM:
- L822: - uv exact pin — PLAN says "uv" / mise uses `latest`; pin an exact version once Phase 3's api Dockerfile depends on it. (⚠️ TO CONFIRM)
- L823: - Ruff lefthook scoping — exact `uv run --project …` invocation for "scoped to the touched product's api" is finalized in Phase 3 when an api exists; the `$(dirname …)` heuristic here is provisional. (⚠️ TO CONFIRM)
- L824: - pre-push pyright/pytest path — assumed to flow through turbo's per-api `typecheck`/`test` tasks (cached + affected). Confirm vs. explicit lefthook commands in Phase 3. (⚠️ TO CONFIRM)
- L825: - Exact dep versions — only Turborepo (2.9) and the Node/pnpm/Python pins are PLAN-locked; prettier/lefthook/eslint/typescript ranges are conventional defaults — replace with lockfile-resolved pins. (⚠️ TO CONFIRM)
- L826: - tailwind preset module format — CJS-shaped `.js` under an ESM package may need a `.cjs` rename depending on the NativeWind v4 Tailwind loader; verify in Phase 2. (⚠️ TO CONFIRM)
- L827: - `packages/config` `lint` task — Phase 1 has no lintable source there, so `turbo run lint` is a true no-op. Wire a real `lint` script into `@platform/config` (and into each package's `package.json`) so the turbo `lint` task does meaningful work from Phase 2 onward. (⚠️ TO CONFIRM)

## 2. TODO / PLACEHOLDER fill-in tokens (intentional swap-points — counted, not gaps)

- `docs/phase-2-design-system.md`: 10
- `docs/phase-3-api.md`: 1
- `docs/phase-5-desktop.md`: 14
- `docs/phase-6-auth.md`: 7
- `docs/phase-7-generator.md`: 35
- `docs/phase-8-cicd-obs.md`: 20

Canonical swap-points: `example` (org), `com.example.*` (bundle/appId), `TODO-EAS-PROJECT-ID`, `TODO-FIGMA-FILE-KEY`, `TODO-FIGMA-MODE-ID`, `PLACEHOLDER-pin-exact` (version pins), `PLACEHOLDER` secret/org names — all verified by the Phase 7/8 `git grep -inE 'example|TODO'` gate.

## 3. Deferred-by-design

See each guide's `## Open questions / deferred` section (the entries marked *Deferred* / *RESOLVED*). The dependent phase's `## Prerequisites` re-checks them; the cross-phase map is in PLAN.md's "Accuracy review" + phases table.
